It is based on the Matrix protocol, which is an open standard for secure, decentralised communication. The chat client is called Element, providing the open source, free-of-charge Slack-like experience. It is available to you as a student and is hosted by ETH Zurich.\nYou can reach out to the course instructor and other students any time, and we have a way to stay in touch beyond the course itself.\nTo set it up, please follow the steps below:\n\nDownload and install Element: https://element.io/download. It is available on Linux, Mac OS, and Windows.\nOpen the Element app on your device.\nClick Sign in\nIn the Homeserver section, click Edit\n\n\n\nSelect Other homeserver and type studentchat.ethz.ch\n\n\n\nSign in with your ETH username and ETH password\n\n\n\nVerify your device by creating a security key and store it securely. You will need the security key for adding another devices or logging back in on the same device.\n\n\n\nWelcome! Get in touch with me on Element by searching my ETH username lschoebitz.\n\n 9.
