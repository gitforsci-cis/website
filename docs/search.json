    "text": "Emails are not a very quick, responsive way of communication. We avoid them by prioritising other channels. At ETH Zurich, we have a chat server that is used by many courses and groups. It is based on the Matrix protocol, which is an open standard for secure, decentralised communication. The chat client is called Element, providing the open source, free-of-charge Slack-like experience. It is available to you as a student and is hosted by ETH Zurich.\nYou can reach out to the course instructor and other students any time, and we have a way to stay in touch beyond the course itself.\nTo set it up, please follow the steps below:\n\nDownload and install Element: https://element.io/download. It is available on Linux, Mac OS, and Windows.\nOpen the Element app on your device.\nClick Sign in\nIn the Homeserver section, click Edit\n\n\n\nSelect Other homeserver and type studentchat.ethz.ch\n\n\n\nSign in with your ETH username and ETH password\n\n\n\nVerify your device by creating a security key and store it securely. You will need the security key for adding another devices or logging back in on the same device.\n\n\n\nWelcome! Get in touch with me on Element by searching my ETH username lschoebitz.\n\n 9.

Yes, all those names are totally confusing, but you might encounter them elsewhere and I want you to be well-informed.\nWe like this because Git for Windows leaves the Git executable in a conventional location, which will help you and other programs, e.g. RStudio, find it and use it. This also supports a transition to more expert use, because the “Git Bash” shell will be useful as you venture outside of R/RStudio.\n\nNOTE: When asked about “Adjusting your PATH environment”, make sure to select “Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software”. Otherwise, we believe it is good to accept the defaults.\nNote that RStudio for Windows prefers for Git to be installed below C:/Program Files and this appears to be the default. This implies, for example, that the Git executable on my Windows system is found at C:/Program Files/Git/bin/git.exe. Unless you have specific reasons to otherwise, follow this convention.\n\n\n\n\nIt’s slightly more complicated. Please get in touch through Element if you have questions.\nOption 1 (highly recommended): Install the Xcode command line tools (not all of Xcode), which includes Git.\n\nOpen the Terminal application on Mac and type xcode-select --install. If you don’t have it installed, you will be prompted to install the Xcode command line tools. Follow the instructions.\n\nOption 2 (recommended): If you anticipate getting heavily into scientific computing, you’re going to be installing and updating lots of software. You should check out Homebrew, “the missing package manager for OS X”. Among many other things, it can install Git for you.\n\nOpen the Terminal application on Mac, copy and run the following line:\n\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\nThis will install Homebrew. You may be prompted for your password. If you are, type it in and hit enter.
